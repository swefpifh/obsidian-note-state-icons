# Obsidian - Note State Icons

**Obsidian Note State Icons** is an open-source plugin for Obsidian that lets you assign a **visual state** to notes using **icons displayed directly in the File Explorer**.

The purpose of this plugin is to provide **clear, immediate visual feedback** about the role, category, or status of a note — without modifying the note content itself.

---

## ✨ Features

- Assign an **icon-based state** to any Markdown note
- Icons are displayed **only in the File Explorer**
- No tags, no frontmatter, no text injection inside notes
- States are **persistent** across Obsidian restarts
- Works efficiently with large vaults
- Lightweight and unobtrusive
- Fully desktop-focused UI behavior

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Right-click a note in the File Explorer
2. Open the **State** menu
3. Select a state from the list
4. The selected icon appears **next to the note title**

To remove a state, choose **None**.

All states are stored internally and restored automatically when Obsidian is restarted.
